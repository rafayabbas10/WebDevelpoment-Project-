                <h1>4 Benefits of Travelling as a Hobby</h1>
                <p>There are many benefits of travelling as a hobby from seeing amazing new places and understanding different cultures to a personal feeling of accomplishment and even learning a new language.

                    Let’s start off with the basics though:</p>
                <h3>1. Understanding Different Cultures</h3>
                <p>One of my favourite reasons for having travel as a hobby is being able to immerse myself in different countries and cultures rather than seeing them on screen or reading about them in a book.

                I’m not trying to claim for one second that spending a week in another country teaches you everything about the place (I’ve lived in Australia for two years now and have barely even scratched the surface) but I certainly feel it gives me more understanding and appreciation of a culture than never having visited. When I can talk to people, live alongside them, shop in the places they do and feel out of my comfort zone in their world, it begins to help me realise some of what is important. I often quickly realise how little difference there is when all is said and done, we all want a happy, healthy family, somewhere safe to live and a decent meal at the end of the day </p>
                <h3>2. Seeing Amazing Places</h3>
                <p><span>“To travel is to discover that everyone is wrong about other countries.”</span><br>Whilst I don’t completely agree with the quote above (see my commentary piece on Medium here) I do agree that the only way to truly comprehend the amazing places on Earth is to see them with your own eyes.

                It’s easy to be an armchair traveller or documentary discoverer, forming an ‘expert’ opinion based on books and photography, but the only way to really understand is to be there. Flick through all the photos of Angkor Wat you want, but it’s not until you go that you appreciate its size, see the detail of the bas-reliefs, smell the incense blowing through ancient corridors or feel the humidity that the gets held inside the huge sandstone buildings.

                So, maybe not everyone is wrong about other countries, but you simply won’t know until you visit for yourself.</p>
                <h3>3. Meeting New People</h3>
                <p>My Instagram account is absolutely filled with people who I’ve briefly crossed paths with whilst travelling and my phone book has the numbers of a few that have become more than just people we’ve passed on the way.

                Whilst most don’t become lifelong friends, the colourful characters we meet on the road become part of the stories we tell for a lifetime.
                    
                To the Thai teenager who quizzed my wife and I for nearly two hours as we all waited for a delayed train, asking us questions to help improve her English, including such killers as ‘why exactly do you love your wife?’ and ‘what is your favourite thing about her?’. Just a tad awkward.
                    
                To Clay, who we followed around the Thakhek Loop in Laos, sharing travel stories over an evening fire.
                    
                To Sara and Miguel, with whom we spent three hours doing a cooking course in Thailand and laughing so hard that it felt like we’d known each other for years.
                    
                To all of you, and the hundreds of others we’ve met, thank you.</p>
                <h3>4. Learning a New Language</h3>
                <p><span>“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.”</span><br>Ok, so a straight up confession here, I speak one language, and that’s English…

                …and there are some who would argue I haven’t exactly mastered that yet.
                    
                But, if you are someone who’s learning a new language, travelling as a hobby can really help you out by immersing yourself in exactly that language you’re hoping to learn.
                    
                A friend of mine has moved to Germany and it’s amazing how quickly he’s picked up the language now he’s surrounded by it. He does everything to accelerate his learning, from watching The Simpsons in German through to changing the instructions and menus on video games into the language.
                    
                    
                I made a similar move abroad, but mine was to Australia, and whilst I’ve got really good at ‘how ya going’ and ‘too easy’ it’s not exactly a second language to add to the CV.</p>
